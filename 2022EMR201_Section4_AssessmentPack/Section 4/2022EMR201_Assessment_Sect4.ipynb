Although the company will start with only a few products to sell, the number and quantity of products will increase as the company grows.

A block of mass $m$ is fastened to a massless rod of length $L$. The massless rod is connected to an angular spring. When the block is moved from its resting position (i.e. $\\theta$=0 rad) and let go from position $\\theta=2\\pi\\ rad$, it rotates back and forth following an angular path. The primary forces acting on the block are defined as $F_s$ the spring force and $F_d$ the damping force resulting from friction.  \n","\n","<img src=\"Torque_spring_sys.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\">\n","\n","You have been tasked with modelling and solving this system mathematically in order to describe how the angle $\\theta$ varies as a function of time.

This is defined mathematically as:\n","\n","\\begin{equation*}\n","\\sum F = ma\n","\\label{eq:newton_2} \\tag{1}\n","\\end{equation*}\n","\n","\n","Since the normal force equals the gravitational force acting on the block, one only needs to summarize the forces acting on the block along its path of movement. Eq. $\\eqref{eq:sum_forces}$ demonstrates the summation of all the forces in the x-direction for a translational movement. \n","\n","\\begin{equation*}\n","\\sum F = F - kx - b\\ddot x\n","\\label{eq:sum_forces} \\tag{2}\n","\\end{equation*}\n","\n","\n","However, the block in our Mass-Spring-Pendulum system is moving in an angular motion. Therefore Newton's Second Law given in eq. $\\eqref{eq:newton_2}$ should be modified for rotational movement as shown in eq. $\\eqref{eq:moments}$.\n","\n","\\begin{equation*}\n","\\sum M = I\\alpha\n","\\label{eq:moments} \\tag{3}\n","\\end{equation*}\n","\n","\n","Where $M$ is the sum of moments, $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\\alpha$ is the angular acceleration.\n","\n","The expression in eq. $\\eqref{eq:sum_forces}$ can also be translated into an expression for rotational movement by using the angular displacement of the block denoted by $\\theta$, instead of the linear displacement, $x$. Also, the initial displacement of the block from equilibrium will cause the mass to move instead of a constant applied force. Therefore, the only forces acting on the mass along the path of movement are the damping force and the spring force.
